                            An unconventional personality, Bharat Thakur has a small but fiercely loyal group of
                            students who embrace his idiosyncratic and paradoxical approach to spirituality. He refuses
                            to be pigeonholed, rejecting ashrams and followers of all kinds. He believes that the
                            student-teacher relationship is personal and unique and cannot be packaged or commoditised.
                            Despite his close circuit of friends and well-known personalities in all walks of life, he
                            claims to be a catalyst; completely uninvolved in his students processes but always
                            available to them when required. He prefers to lead a normal life, pursuing his many
                            passions with an obsessive energy that permeates all aspects of his life.
